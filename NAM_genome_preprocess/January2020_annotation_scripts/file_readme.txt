This folder contains scripts used to pre-process the NAM parent genome assemblies.
These scripts are for the annotations in the original 2020 release. 
As of 02/03/2020 there are 2 versions of the edit_gene_name python script, since I had to write a version to remove 'nested' genes. This should be unncesessary in the final version. 
Update 05/05/2020: most of these scripts will not be used in the final version of this pipeline, since the annotations have changed.
